# vsmod-GeothermalInsanity

A WIP mod for making living underground in Vintage Story more doable by creating an underground weather environment similar to real-world data.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Requires client has mod installed locally or temperature reading on HUDs will be inaccurate (confirmed); player *MAY* go hypothermic (unconfirmed).
- Release v1.1.0 maintains requirement for client-side install and will announce such on server join due to above issue.

Shamelessly hiked from chriswa's code. Original README.md contents:
